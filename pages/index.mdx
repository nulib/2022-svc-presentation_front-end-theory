```html
<main><!--- insert manifest ---></main>
```

1. One viewer cannot handle it all
2. Explode the manifest, drop the monolith viewer
3. The IIIF _viewer_ is the `<main>`

# Standards

<Steps>
  <Step>JavaScript</Step>
  <Step>Web/Browser API</Step>
</Steps>

# Established, community vetted projects

<Steps>
  <Step>ESBuild</Step>
  <Step>NextJS</Step>
  <Step>React</Step>
  <Step>TypeScript</Step>
</Steps>

<SpeakerNotes>
  All of our UI components and single page apps are built independently, and we
  aim to strike a balance between standards (Javascript / Web/Browser API),
  established community-vetted open source projects (React/ESBuild). blending in
  some newer experimental packages.
